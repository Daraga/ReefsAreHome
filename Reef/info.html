            <p>The Great Barrier Reef, located off the coast of Queensland, Australia, is the largest coral reef system in the world. It is home to a wide range of life, including fish, sea turtles, giant clams, seahorses, sea snakes, nudibranch, sea turtles, stingrays, sharks and many more. Climate change poses the greatest threat to the Great Barrier Reef - an increase in ocean temperatures and acidity levels create heat stress and decrease the capacity for corals to build their indispensable skeletons.</p>
            <p>Here are some ways you can help save the reefs:</p>
            <ul class="facts">

                <li>If you dive, don't touch</li>
                <li>Conserve water (i.e: use reusable bottles and hang your hotel towels so they don’t get washed every day)</li>
                <li>Use environmentally-friendly modes of transportation</li>
